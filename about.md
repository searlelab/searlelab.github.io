### About us
The Searle Lab develops bioinformatics, mass spectrometry, and proteomics technologies as part of the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences at the Mayo Clinic. We focus on using proteomics and genomics to study a wide variety of human diseases.

### Research
Interpreting data is one of the biggest challenges for researchers in proteomics. We make software to make sense of mass spectrometry data from proteomics and metabolomics datasets. Our work specializes in making data generation and analysis both more approachable and more reproducible. We also have a dedicated mass spectrometry lab where we can develop new data acquisition technologies and run our own experiments. Visit our [research page](../research/) to see more information on each research focus.

### Lab Members
Our research group is remarkably interdisciplinary. We have backgounds in bioinformatics, chemistry, biology, statistics, computer science, and many other disciplines. Visit our [people page](../people/) to see more information on each person who works in the lab (publications, contact information, photos). If you're interested in joining us, please visit our [available positions and fellowships](../jobs) for more details.

### Lab Culture
Our lab is a great place to develop as a scientist. We valueâ€¦
- Diversity of people, backgrounds, and ideas
- Independence, cleverness, and tenacity
- Self learning, but knowing when you need help
- Communication through papers, conferences, and teaching
- Cross training, since no one has every skill
- Helping you make the next move in your career, wherever that will be
