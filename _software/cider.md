### Description

CIDer is a simple Python3 compatible script that will "CID correct" spectrum libraries acquired by HCD in DLIB format. The conversion is based on a series of linear weights that were learned across multiple NCE settings (6 values spanning 20 to 35) with interpolations for all intermediate values.
