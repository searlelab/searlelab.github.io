### Description

Crosstraq is an open-source Java library for removing sources of interference from iTRAQ and TMT data. Data interpretation in TMT and iTRAQ experiments is complicated by two factors: chemical contamination and isotopic contamination. Chemical contamination in proteomics measurements occurs when multiple peptides with similar precursor masses are co-isolated and co-fragmented. Isotopic contamination is caused because isobaric tagging reagents cannot be produced with 100% purity. Crosstraq is a tool to help mitigate both sources of error.
