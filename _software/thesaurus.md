### Description

The human phosphorylation regulatory network represents a complex signaling cascade where proteins can be phosphorylated at multiple sites resulting in different functional states. Here we present Thesaurus, a hybrid search engine that detects, localizes, and quantifies novel positional isomers using site-specific fragment ions directly from data independent acquisition mass spectrometry experiments. This software works for several PTMs in addition to phosphorylation. 

The Thesaurus project has been merged into [EncyclopeDIA](https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia), a joint open source project with the same goals. You can now access the latest version of Thesaurus in [encyclopedia-0.9.5](https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia/downloads/encyclopedia-0.9.5-executable.jar) or higher.
